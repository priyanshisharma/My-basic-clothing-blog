# My Basic Clothing Blog
It is called the clothing blog, as it is meant to open the conversation on the uncomfortable as well as the best parts of clothing.

This blogsite was created using Flask Framework.

It is the project I worked on when I was starting out with Backend Development, it set me on the right direction and is hence very valuable for me.

I used an online course by Jose Portilla at Udemy to make this. This is a little variation on the project he demonstrates in that course.
